# Fluentd
---

This repository holds reference code and configuration for fluentd.

The `with-opensearch` directory contains configuration code that demonstrates how to 
setup fluentd to forward data to OpenSearch.

In the rest of the directories we use Docker Compose to start only the fluentd container, and we'll just use the `stdout` output plugin.
